## Notes
- 2026-09-22: Repo created fresh at `C:\dev\omnigrowth` from the governance pack + user-supplied spec.
- 2026-09-23: Phase 1 ADRs 0001–0008 ACCEPTED (human "proceed"); decisions D1 (minimal analytics + recommendations in Phase 7), D2 (YouTube/Instagram NOT_IMPLEMENTED in MVP E2E), Q6 (LIVE needs HUMAN approval), partial unique idempotency index — recorded in docs.
- Phase 2: skeleton + core backend. Stack runs with `docker compose up -d --build --wait` (project `omnigrowth`, ports 8000 / 55432 / 56379 on 127.0.0.1). Local `.env` (git-ignored) holds a generated DB password.
- Windows: psycopg async needs a selector event loop → `omnigrowth.core.aio` (tests, scheduler, `poe api --loop`). RQ on Windows uses `WindowsWorker` (SimpleWorker + TimerDeathPenalty) via `poe worker`.
- Phase 3: model layer (providers, router, structured generation, prompt registry, model probe). Live smoke on LM Studio qwen/qwen3.5-9b passed; see docs/audit/phase3_*.json.
- Phase 4: auth, brand system, ingestion parsers, SSRF-guarded URL ingestion, sources API + durable jobs, body/rate limits. First OWNER: `uv run poe create-owner --email you@example.com`.
